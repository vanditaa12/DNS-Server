# DNS Server in Go

## Overview
DNS Server in Go is a fast and efficient resolver that translates domain names into IP addresses. It supports recursive or authoritative resolution, caching for faster responses, and can include security features like DNSSEC. Built with Goâ€™s concurrency, it ensures high performance and scalability.

## Usage
- The server listens for DNS queries and returns the corresponding IP addresses.
- Configure your local network settings to use this DNS server for resolution.

## Configuration
Modify `config.json` or environment variables to customize server settings like:
- Port number
- Cache expiration time
- Logging options
